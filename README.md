### Description

A 3D-printable replacement scroll wheel for the G604 mouse. This is meant to be a compatible replacement, _not_ a recreation. As a result of being compatible, many similarities are inevitable but unintended.

The reduced weight is an upgrade for gaming, but the infinite scroll ability is lost as it relies on a heavy wheel.

### Weight comparison

* Old wheel: 12.9 g (12.3 g metal, 0.6 g plastic)
* New wheel: 0.8 g

Weight measurements from a 0.2 mm nozzle PETG print. Further weight reductions are possible through improved 3D printing methods.
