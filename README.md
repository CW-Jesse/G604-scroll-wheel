### Description

A 3D-printable replacement scroll wheel for the G604 mouse. This is meant to be a compatible replacement, _not_ a recreation. As a result of being compatible, many similarities are inevitable but unintended.

The reduced weight is an upgrade for gaming, but the infinite scroll ability is lost as it relies a the heavy wheel.

### Weight comparison

* Original: 141.1 g (source: RTings)
* New wheel: 124.4 g (12% lighter)
* New wheel + AAA battery: 110.4 g (22% lighter)

Weight measurements from a 0.2 mm nozzle PETG print (shown in video demo below). Further weight reductions are possible through improved 3D printing methods such as removing top and bottom shell layers and reducing infill.
